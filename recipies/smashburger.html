        <h3>An american classic - fresh beef, smashed thin and cooked well-done with traditional burger fixings.</h3>
        <p>The smashburger fills an important niche in the hierarchy of burgers within American cuisine. First created in the Dairy Cheer restaurant in Kentucky around the middle of the 20th century, it was a practical solution to an old problem -- burgers that were thicker took longer to cook, and if cooked at a high temperature, cooked unevenly. Originally using a heavy can of beans, the fry cook at Dairy Cheer smashed the burgers flat and kept them pressed to the grill, and the smashburger was born.</p>
        <p>Smashburgers are traditionally served on a thin, toasted bun, with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and American cheese. The recipe below is a classic taste on this old American classic, and should be served hot and cooked en masse.</p>
